# Roadmap

## Day 1 — project foundation

- Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and shadcn/ui
- Supabase authentication clients and flows
- Drizzle/PostgreSQL configuration
- initial identity and organization schema with RLS

## Day 2 — organization workspaces

- transactional organization creation and OWNER assignment
- reusable role-based server authorization
- authorized workspace listing and persistent selection
- onboarding and workspace UI states
- strengthened membership RLS migration
- Vitest, RLS integration, and Playwright test coverage

Live migration, RLS, and authentication verification remain environment-dependent and must not be marked passed until development credentials and test identities are configured.

## Day 3 — team management and audit logging

- secure expiring invitations and verified-email atomic acceptance
- OWNER/ADMIN team management and invitation revocation
- protected role changes, member removal, and ownership transfer
- concurrency-safe final-owner invariants
- organization settings and append-only tenant audit events
- Vitest, PostgreSQL RLS, and Playwright coverage

Live migration, RLS, authentication, and browser verification remain blocked
until development credentials and confirmed test identities are configured.

## Recommended Day 4

1. provision separate migration and non-BYPASSRLS runtime roles and apply all migrations;
2. run live authentication, RLS, invitation-delivery, and Playwright verification;
3. add CI with an isolated Supabase test project and disposable identities;
4. add audit-log pagination, filters, retention policy, and actor display names;
5. add invitation resend with rotation and delivery observability;
6. define the first tenant-owned customer model only after isolation is proven end to end.

Customer management, invoices, Stripe, and other business modules should follow only after tenant isolation is proven end to end.
